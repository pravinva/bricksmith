# Logo hints for AGL kit (Unity Catalog same as default — use EXACT uploaded image)
unity-catalog:
  enabled: true
  warning_level: "CRITICAL"
  correct_description: |
    The uploaded Unity Catalog logo file contains MULTIPLE DISTINCT GEOMETRIC SHAPES:
    - Pink/magenta SQUARES (multiple)
    - Yellow/gold TRIANGULAR shapes (multiple)
    - Navy blue HEXAGON (one, in center)
    These shapes are arranged in a SPECIFIC cluster/constellation pattern - NOT a single shape.
  wrong_patterns:
    - "A single hexagon shape"
    - "A stylized hexagon"
    - "A multi-colored hexagonal logo"
    - "Any single geometric shape"
    - "Any logo you generate/draw yourself"
  stop_condition: "If you find yourself drawing or generating ANY hexagon shape, STOP - that is wrong. The correct logo is a MULTI-ELEMENT composition that was uploaded as an image file."
  additional_notes: "You MUST use the EXACT uploaded Unity Catalog image file from the logo kit."
