**Subject:**
A clean hierarchical architecture diagram titled "Data Intelligence Platform" with Databricks logo in top-left.

**Style:**
Clean, professional, modern. White background. Databricks orange (#FF3621) and navy (#1B3139) accents. Simple stacked layers with clear hierarchy.

**Key Message:**
Data Intelligence is now OPERATIONAL - embedded directly into apps, insights, and automated actions. The App Layer is where intelligence becomes action.

DO NOT add numbered circles, step indicators, or annotations unless explicitly requested.

=== LAYOUT (4 Horizontal Layers, Top to Bottom) ===

LAYER 1 - APP LAYER (Top - where intelligence becomes action):
Orange-accented header bar, prominent position
Title: "Intelligent Apps & Actions"
Three boxes side by side:
- "AI/BI Dashboards" - "Natural language insights"
- "Agent Bricks" - "Autonomous decisions"
- "Custom Apps" - "Embedded intelligence"
Small text below: "Data Intelligence operationalized"

LAYER 2 - INTELLIGENCE ENGINE:
Large container with Databricks logo
Title: "Databricks Intelligence Platform"
Three components in a row:
- "Lakeflow" (Ingest & ETL)
- "DBSQL" (Analytics)
- "Agent Bricks" (ML & GenAI)
Subtitle: "Unified compute for all workloads"

LAYER 3 - GOVERNED DATA:
Full-width bar with Unity Catalog logo
Title: "Unity Catalog"
Subtitle: "Security • Governance • Lineage • Sharing"
Show it spanning the full width - governance touches everything

LAYER 4 - OPEN LAKEHOUSE (Bottom):
Navy/dark background
Title: "Open Data Lakehouse"
Three elements: [Delta Lake logo] "Delta Lake" | "Iceberg" | "Parquet"
Subtitle: "Any data, any format, open standards"

FOOTER - Cloud Foundation (subtle, grey):
Light grey, less prominent
[AWS logo] [Azure logo] "GCP"
Text: "Multi-cloud • Serverless"

=== VISUAL FLOW ===

Show simple upward arrows between layers:
- Data flows UP from Lakehouse → through Governance → through Intelligence → to Apps
- The story: Raw data becomes governed data becomes intelligent insights becomes automated action

=== COLOR CODING ===
- App Layer: Orange accent (this is the new, important part)
- Intelligence: White with orange borders
- Governance: Orange bar (Unity Catalog)
- Lakehouse: Navy/dark
- Cloud: Light grey (infrastructure fades away)

=== KEY DIFFERENTIATOR ===
The App Layer at the TOP is the key message - Data Intelligence isn't just about storing and processing data, it's about operationalizing intelligence into real applications, dashboards, and autonomous agents that take action.

=== ASPECT RATIO ===
16:9 landscape, presentation-ready
