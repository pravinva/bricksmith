⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: UNITY CATALOG LOGO INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**WHAT THE CORRECT UNITY CATALOG LOGO LOOKS LIKE:**
The uploaded Unity Catalog logo file contains MULTIPLE DISTINCT GEOMETRIC SHAPES:
- Pink/magenta SQUARES (multiple)
- Yellow/gold TRIANGULAR shapes (multiple)
- Navy blue HEXAGON (one, in center)
These shapes are arranged in a SPECIFIC cluster/constellation pattern - NOT a single shape.

**WHAT THE WRONG LOGO LOOKS LIKE (DO NOT DO THIS):**
- A single hexagon shape
- A stylized hexagon
- A "multi-colored hexagonal logo"
- Any single geometric shape
- Any logo you generate/draw yourself

**INSTRUCTION:** You MUST use the EXACT uploaded Unity Catalog image file from the logo kit. If you find yourself drawing or generating ANY hexagon shape, STOP - that is wrong. The correct logo is a MULTI-ELEMENT composition that was uploaded as an image file.

DO NOT draw one continuous connected line. Instead, draw FOUR SEPARATE, INDIVIDUAL arrows:

   - Label: "Data enriched"
   - This arrow is NOT connected to any other arrow

2. **Arrow 2:** Standalone arrow from Governance layer UP to Intelligence Engine layer
   - Label: "Data governed"
   - This arrow is NOT connected to any other arrow

3. **Arrow 3:** Standalone arrow from Intelligence Engine layer UP to Apps layer
   - Label: "Insights generated"
   - This arrow is NOT connected to any other arrow

4. **Arrow 4:** Standalone arrow from Apps layer UP to Real-World layer
   - Label: "Actions taken"
   - This arrow is NOT connected to any other arrow

**Arrow Style for ALL four arrows:**
- Each arrow is INDEPENDENT and SEPARATE
- Color: Navy (#1B3139)
- Thickness: 2px (thin, elegant)
- Each arrow has its own arrowhead pointing UP
- Small gap/space between each arrow (they do NOT touch or connect)
- Position: Left margin of the diagram

**RIGHT SIDE - Feedback Loop:**
