Create a professional architecture diagram showing how Databricks Lakebase unifies analytical and operational data states - the dream realized.

**The Problem (Left Side - "Before"):**
For decades, enterprises have paid an "architectural tax" keeping operational and analytical data separate:
- OLTP databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) for apps - transactions, low-latency, real-time
- OLAP systems (warehouses, lakehouses) for analytics - complex queries, ML, BI
- Fragile ETL pipelines copying data between systems
- Stale analytics (hours/days behind operational reality)
- Separate security models, duplicate governance overhead
- Database as bottleneck - queries competing for fixed CPU/memory

**The Solution (Center - "Lakebase"):**
Databricks Lakebase - fully managed serverless PostgreSQL that runs OLTP directly on the Lakehouse:

Key capabilities to visualize:
- Serverless autoscaling (scales to demand, scales to zero when idle)
- Instant database branching (zero-copy clones for safe dev/test)
- Point-in-time recovery (millisecond-level restore)
- Compute separated from storage (no resource conflicts)
- PostgreSQL compatible (use existing tools, frameworks, ORMs)

**The Dream Realized (Right Side - "After"):**
One unified platform for apps, analytics, and AI:

- **Sync Tables**: Operational data automatically syncs to Delta Lake - no ETL pipelines
- **Unity Catalog**: Single governance layer spanning OLTP and analytics
- **Real-time feature serving**: ML models access fresh operational data with low latency
- **Persistent memory for AI agents**: Agents read/write operational state governed by Unity Catalog
- **Embedded analytics**: Combine live operational data with historical lakehouse insights

**Data Flow Arrows:**
1. User apps → Lakebase (low-latency transactions)
2. Lakebase ⟷ Delta Lake (automatic sync, bidirectional)
3. Lakehouse → ML training (historical + operational data)
4. ML models → Lakebase (predictions, enrichments back to apps)
5. AI Agents ⟷ Lakebase (persistent memory, governed access)
6. Unity Catalog spans everything (single security model)

**Customer Proof Points (can include as callout boxes):**
- Hafnia: Reduced app delivery from 2 months to 5 days
- easyJet: Replaced legacy SQL Server, cut dev cycles from 9 months to 4
- Warner Music Group: "Analytics and operational workloads work together in real-time"

**Visual Style:**
- Clean, modern enterprise architecture diagram
- Show clear "Before/After" or "Old World/New World" contrast
- Databricks orange/red color palette
- Emphasize the UNITY - one platform, one governance, one data foundation
- Show Lakebase as the bridge/nexus connecting operational and analytical worlds
- Include Unity Catalog as the umbrella/roof spanning both sides

**Key Message:**
"A new category of database architecture that runs OLTP directly on the cloud object store, enabling a unified, elastic, and AI-ready operational data foundation."
