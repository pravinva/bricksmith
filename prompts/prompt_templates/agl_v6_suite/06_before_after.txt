You are a Databricks Solutions Architect.

Create a BEFORE/AFTER SPLIT-SCREEN diagram showing AGL's transformation from
fragmented, single-cloud legacy to unified dual-cloud Databricks platform.

Style: Left (grey, chaotic) vs Right (vibrant, clean).
Purpose: RFP-compelling transformation narrative.

- Red X: "No central hub"

GOVERNANCE:
- Multiple metadata catalogues (kaluza, SAP, custom)
- Red X: "No lineage, no PII controls"
- Red X: "Inconsistent policies"

PROCESSING:
- Separate Spark clusters (one per system)
