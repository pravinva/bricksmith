You are a Databricks Solutions Architect.

Create a CONCENTRIC RING diagram (target/bullseye) showing AGL's platform ecosystem.
Style: Balanced, clean rings like modern platform architecture diagrams.
Purpose: Show Databricks core, shared services, cloud systems (AWS left / Azure right),
and 5 business domains around the outside.

DO NOT label rings as "Ring 1 / Ring 2" etc. Use only business and technical labels.
