SPELLING MUST BE PERFECT. Double-check ALL text before finalizing:
- "Databricks" (not "Databrick")
- "Kaluza" (not "Kaluze" or "Kalusa")
- "Lakeflow" (not "Lake Flow")
- "Genie" (not "Agenicks" or "Agenics")
- "AIBI" (AI/BI product)
- "Unity Catalog" (not "Unity Catalogue")
Review every word carefully!
