Create a simplified Databricks reference architecture diagram (101 version) for a banking Treasury + CFO use case that can be reused across streams.

Objective:
- Make it easy to digest for broad audiences.
- Preserve the core operating model without deep implementation detail.
- Use an abstraction pattern that can be standardized for other domains.

Diagram title:
- Banking Treasury Reference Architecture

Visual and branding requirements:
- Databricks visual style: clean, modern, minimal clutter, high readability.
- Use Databricks brand palette only:
  - Navy: #1B3139
  - Cyan: #00A8E1
  - Lava: #FF3621
- White background and strong Databricks architecture composition.
- Left-to-right flow with consistent spacing and alignment.
- Use short labels (2-4 words where possible).
- Do not render color names or hex codes as visible text.

Databricks architecture aesthetic (enforce strongly):
- Zone containers: white fill, navy borders, subtle rounded corners, thin neutral separators.
- Section headers: navy header bars with white text for each layer.
- Primary arrows and data flow: cyan lines with clear arrowheads and consistent stroke width.
- Strategic emphasis elements only: lava for key differentiators (maturity progression and decision outputs).
- Icons: flat line icons only (database, model, workflow, dashboard), no 3D or gradients.
- Typography feel: modern sans-serif, medium weight headings, regular body labels, high contrast.
- Keep overall look executive and "Databricks solution architecture slide" quality.
- Spelling quality bar: all visible labels must be correctly spelled business terms.
- Do not invent words, truncate words, or use placeholder text.

Show only these 6 standardized layers (left to right):

Layer 1: Business Sources
- Core banking events
- Finance and ledger data
- Market and macro signals

Layer 2: Lakehouse Foundation
- Bronze (raw ingest)
- Silver (conformed data)
- Gold (finance-ready marts)
- Unity Catalog governance and lineage (cross-cutting)

Layer 3: Feature and Model Factory
- Shared feature engineering
- Model training and validation
- Model registry with champion/challenger aliases

Layer 4: Forecasting and Scenario Engines
- Deposit beta engine (operational)
- Runoff and vintage engine (behavioral)
- Stress and dynamic beta engine (regulatory)
- PPNR projection engine (quarterly baseline + scenarios)

Layer 5: Orchestration and Monitoring
- Scheduled workflows (batch cadence)
- Data quality checks
- Model performance and drift monitoring

Layer 6: Decision and Consumption
- Treasury and CFO dashboards
- Executive scenario compare (baseline vs adverse)
- Planning and ALCO decision support

Narrative callouts (small side notes):
- Weekly/monthly batch operating model (not real-time).
- Final output: quarterly PPNR deltas and explainable drivers.

Standardization guidance to convey visually:
- Show reusable blueprint blocks as clean named capability groups only:
  - Source Adapters
  - Medallion Foundation
  - Model Factory
  - Scenario Engine
  - Decision Layer
- Do not place the word "template" anywhere in the diagram.
- Keep table/notebook names out of the 101 diagram.
- Emphasize pattern over implementation specifics.

Place the 3-approach explanation in a separate legend panel outside the main flow:
- Put this panel at top-right or bottom-right margin, not inside process boxes.
- Title: "Approach Progression"
- Bullets:
  - Approach 1: Static beta for daily ALM support
  - Approach 2: Vintage and runoff for behavior-aware forecasting
  - Approach 3: Dynamic beta and stress for regulatory scenarios
- Ensure this legend never overlaps architecture boxes, arrows, or labels.
