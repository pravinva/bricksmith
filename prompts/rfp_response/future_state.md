The Databricks Data Intelligence Platform: Addressing AGL's Critical Operational Constraints
The Databricks Data Intelligence Platform on Azure and AWS provides a unified lakehouse architecture that directly resolves AGL's capacity management, performance, governance, and AI enablement challenges through true compute-storage separation, intelligent automation, and enterprise-grade governance—eliminating the operational fragility and data silos that currently impede your strategic transformation to connect 4.56 million customers to a sustainable future.

Elastic Capacity Management: Eliminating Saturation and Fragile Deployments
Serverless compute eliminates the 92% utilisation constraint and manual capacity management by providing instant, elastic compute that provisions in 5-10 seconds and automatically scales from zero to 2,000+ nodes based on workload demand—without production downtime.
Intelligent Workload Management (IWM) uses AI-powered prediction models to dynamically allocate resources for the 3,000+ queries per 10-minute peak loads in Customer Markets, scaling up to 40 clusters to eliminate queueing whilst scaling down during low demand to avoid over-provisioning costs.
True compute-storage separation allows each layer to scale independently: data resides in ADLS Gen2 or S3 whilst compute runs in managed planes (serverless or classic clusters with autoscaling from 2-2,000+ nodes), eliminating forced over-provisioning and enabling right-sized resources for each workload.
Zero-downtime scaling replaces manual capacity adjustments with elastic, event-driven provisioning that responds to dynamic business needs in real-time, eliminating pipeline failures and access instability reported by business stakeholders.

Platform Performance & Reliability: Predictable, Real-Time Analytics
Photon engine delivers up to 12x better price-performance than traditional cloud data warehouses through a C++-based vectorised query engine that accelerates SQL workloads, aggregations, joins, and DataFrame operations whilst eliminating resource contention between data loads, modelling, and queries.
Isolated compute for workload separation: Databricks SQL serverless warehouses, Lakeflow Jobs clusters, and dedicated analytics compute eliminate resource contention by providing isolated compute environments for ETL, BI queries, and data science—ensuring predictable query performance and decision velocity for business users.
Zero-downtime schema evolution: Delta Lake supports schema evolution without table rebuilds—adding, removing, or renaming columns through automated schema merges whilst maintaining ACID transaction guarantees and backwards compatibility for concurrent readers and writers.
Real-time insights without stale data: Structured Streaming and Delta Lake change data feed enable sub-minute data latency for operational use cases (Collections, customer billing) by processing streaming and batch data on a single copy of data with exactly-once processing guarantees, replacing the multi-hop SAP HANA → ETL → Parquet → Synapse architecture.

Unified Multi-Cloud Governance: Single Source of Truth Across Azure and AWS
Unity Catalog provides the industry's only unified and open governance solution that spans Azure and AWS, delivering a single source of truth for the 15,200+ database objects across Customer Markets, Energy Markets, and Corporate systems—eliminating data fragmentation between Kaluza (AWS), Salesforce (AWS), and Azure-hosted corporate systems.
Cross-cloud data access without replication: Query Kaluza billing/meter data in AWS S3 directly from Azure Databricks using Lakehouse Federation and cross-cloud external locations, ingest Salesforce CRM data via Lakeflow Connect with zero custom code, and build Customer 360 analytics combining AWS and Azure data sources—all under one Unity Catalog instance with consistent data classification, row/column security, and audit logging.
Automated, column-level data lineage captures runtime lineage across all queries, notebooks, workflows, and ML models with 365-day retention, enabling business users to "link data back to source and know its lineage"—eliminating the report sprawl and data trust erosion caused by conflicting metrics across siloed platforms.
Intelligent metadata management and discovery: Catalog Explorer, AI-generated comments, and search capabilities enable business users to discover data assets, understand schemas, and access governed datasets through role-based permissions—answering "I don't know where data is, how do I access it?" and "How can I understand the data I'm looking at?" without tribal knowledge.

Enterprise Governance & Regulatory Compliance: AASB S2 Readiness
Unified RBAC and ABAC enforce fine-grained access control down to row and column levels across all clouds and workspaces, with attribute-based access control (ABAC) policies that inherit downward automatically from catalog to schema to table scope—eliminating fragmented governance and manual access management whilst reducing compliance risk.
Auditable lineage for climate reporting: Automated lineage tracking supports FY26 mandatory climate reporting under AASB S2, providing traceable data provenance for 79 climate metrics across Australia's largest corporate emitter (30.7 MtCO₂e) with user-level audit logs, timestamp metadata, and end-to-end visibility from source to consumption.
Open architecture eliminates vendor lock-in: Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg open formats with consistent APIs across AWS, Azure, and GCP enable workload portability and tool choice (Power BI, Tableau, Python, SQL, R, Scala) without requiring payment to extract data, replacing the closed Synapse architecture.

AI/ML at Enterprise Scale: Enabling "Technology, Digitisation and AI at the Core"
The Agent Bricks platform enables algorithmic battery dispatch, renewable energy forecasting, and VPP orchestration across 1,487 MW of decentralised assets through integrated ML lifecycle management on a data-native platform—eliminating the fragmented technology stack that currently prevents AI/ML operationalisation.
Battery dispatch and renewable forecasting: Databricks enables AI-driven asset optimisation for battery storage scheduling, renewable generation forecasting (solar irradiance, wind speed), and VPP orchestration through MLflow model lifecycle management, Feature Store for reusable features (weather patterns, grid conditions), and Model Serving for real-time inference with sub-10ms latency.
Self-service experimentation and model development: AutoML provides a glass-box solution enabling business users to verify predictive power of datasets and build baseline models through UI or API, whilst Databricks notebooks with AI Assistant support Python, R, SQL, and Scala for data scientists to "profile or experiment" and "develop models to create new datasets" without infrastructure complexity.
Production ML at scale: MLflow tracks experiments, versions, and deployments with automated lineage from raw data → features → models → serving endpoints, whilst Unity Catalog governs all AI assets (models, features, functions) with the same RBAC/ABAC controls as data tables—enabling enterprise-scale AI operationalisation aligned to Business Intelligence value drivers.

Real-Time Processing & Simplified Data Ingestion
Auto Loader and Structured Streaming replace the SAP HANA → ADF → Databricks → Parquet → Synapse Polybase multi-hop architecture with incremental, exactly-once processing that ingests new files as they arrive in cloud storage with sub-minute latency and automatic schema inference—eliminating "High Costs/Timelines for Data Ingestion".
Near-real-time capabilities for Collections and billing: Spark Structured Streaming processes Kafka, Kinesis, Event Hubs, and CDC sources with 5-15 minute latency using continuous processing mode and change data feed tracking, enabling "more frequent data than overnight Batch" for operational use cases whilst maintaining exactly-once semantics and ACID transaction guarantees.
Native connectors and zero-code ingestion: Lakeflow Connect provides 200+ managed connectors for SaaS applications (Salesforce, SAP, Dynamics 365), databases (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL), and streaming sources with zero custom code, automated schema drift handling, and Unity Catalog governance—reducing data engineering toil and accelerating time-to-insight.
