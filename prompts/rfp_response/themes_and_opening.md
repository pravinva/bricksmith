# Key Themes from AGL's Technology Questionnaire

## What We Noticed

Having carefully reviewed your questionnaire, we recognize that AGL is undertaking a strategic platform transformation that goes far beyond technology selection—you're architecting the data foundation that will power your energy business for the next decade. Three priorities emerge clearly from your questions:

**First**, you need enterprise governance that works at scale, with Unity Catalog providing the consolidated, "define once, secure everywhere" model that can span your complex organizational structure.

**Second**, you're rightly focused on migration risk—you need proven approaches, automated tooling like Lakebridge, and rigorous reconciliation to move critical workloads without disrupting operations.

**Third**, you're thinking strategically about the energy transition, asking how we'll help you harness industrial data streams, embed AI for predictive operations, and adapt as your industry evolves.

Our response demonstrates how Databricks' lakehouse architecture, combined with structured migration methodology and deep energy sector experience, directly addresses each of these imperatives while building the internal capabilities AGL needs to sustain long-term value.
