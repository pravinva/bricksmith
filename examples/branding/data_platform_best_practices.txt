**Data Platform Reference Architecture - Visual Best Practices:**

**Layer Structure (Industry Standard):**
- Use clearly defined horizontal swim lanes for each architectural tier
- Standard layers from bottom to top: Sources → Ingestion → Storage → Processing → Serving → Consumption
- Each layer should have a distinct background color or border to show separation
- Maintain consistent layer heights for visual balance

**Visual Clarity Guidelines:**
- Use thick, bold borders (3-4px) around major containers
- Apply subtle background fills to distinguish layers (e.g., light grey, light blue tints)
- Add drop shadows or elevation to make the central platform "pop"
- Use iconography consistently - every major service should have its logo/icon
- Include directional arrows showing data flow (bottom-up or left-right)

**Typography for Readability:**
- Layer titles: 18-24pt bold, ALL CAPS or Title Case
- Component names: 14-16pt bold
- Descriptions: 12-14pt regular
- Use high contrast: dark text on light backgrounds, white text on dark backgrounds
- Add subtle text shadows on colored backgrounds for legibility

**Component Boxes:**
- Rounded corners (8-12px radius) for a modern look
- Consistent padding inside boxes (16-24px)
- Group related components in nested containers
- Use pill shapes or badges for technology labels

**Data Flow Visualization:**
- Thick arrows (3-4px) with arrowheads showing direction
- Use dashed lines for optional/async flows
- Color-code arrows by data type (batch=blue, streaming=orange, API=green)
- Add small labels on arrows describing the data ("events", "batch ETL", "API calls")

**Emphasis Techniques:**
- Make the core platform (Databricks) visually dominant - larger, centered, brighter colors
- Use a "glow" or highlighted border around the most important component
- Fade or desaturate peripheral/external systems
- Add a subtle grid pattern to the background for engineering blueprint feel

**Professional Polish:**
- Align all elements to an invisible grid
- Equal spacing between similar components
- Symmetrical layout where possible
- Include a legend if using multiple icon types or line styles
- Add version number or date in corner for documentation purposes
