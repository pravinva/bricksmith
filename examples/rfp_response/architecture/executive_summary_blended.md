AGL Energy's transformation to connect 4.56 million customers whilst transitioning to 12 GW renewable capacity by 2035 requires a data platform that eliminates operational fragility, unifies fragmented systems, and enables AI-driven innovation at scale. The Databricks Data Intelligence Platform addresses three critical imperatives underpinning this strategic shift.

**Unified Governance Eliminating Multi-Cloud Fragmentation**

AGL's data estate spans AWS (Kaluza billing platform, Salesforce) and Azure (corporate systems), creating silos across 15,200+ database objects that prevent unified analytics and slow decision-making. Unity Catalog provides cross-cloud governance with fine-grained access controls, automated data classification, and centralised audit trails - enabling federated queries across Kaluza customer data and Azure corporate systems without replication. Automated PII detection and attribute-based access controls ensure compliance with Australian Privacy Principles whilst reducing manual governance effort by 80%. AI-powered data discovery with natural language search resolves the "How can I understand the data I'm looking at?" challenge, surfacing relevant datasets with lineage, quality metrics, and business context in seconds rather than hours.

**Operational Resilience Through Intelligent Automation**

Current operational fragility - "access is unstable, or pipelines fail" at 92% utilisation - threatens service delivery and regulatory compliance. Serverless compute eliminates capacity constraints with automatic scaling from zero to 2,000+ nodes in under 10 seconds, whilst Predictive Optimisation delivers 70% faster queries through automated maintenance of Delta Lake tables without manual tuning. Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines replace fragile multi-hop architectures with self-healing, declarative data flows that automatically handle schema evolution and quality validation - reducing pipeline failures and ensuring fresh data for NEM settlement and customer billing. Real-time streaming with sub-second latency enables continuous processing of interval meter data and SCADA telemetry from generation assets, supporting both operational dashboards and wholesale market participation.

**AI-Enabled Transformation for Competitive Advantage**

Databricks' Agent Bricks capabilities position AGL to lead the energy sector in AI adoption whilst maintaining rigorous governance. AI/BI Genie democratises analytics through natural language queries, enabling business users to self-serve insights without SQL expertise or data team bottlenecks. The Agent Framework supports production GenAI applications across customer service chatbots, trading operations analysing NEM price signals for battery dispatch, and predictive maintenance for generation assets - all governed by Unity Catalog with comprehensive audit trails. Multi-AI Indemnity covering OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google models eliminates procurement barriers and legal risk for customer-facing AI deployments. Purpose-built capabilities for renewable forecasting, VPP orchestration across 1,487 MW of decentralised assets, and real-time grid operations support AGL's strategic expansion whilst maintaining data sovereignty within Australian cloud regions.

**Measurable Business Impact**

This unified platform delivers quantifiable outcomes: 10x faster time-to-insight through serverless compute and AI-assisted analytics; 80% reduction in governance overhead via automated classification and policy enforcement; 70% query performance improvement from intelligent optimisation; and production-ready GenAI capabilities supporting the "Technology, Digitisation and AI at the Core" strategic pillar. By eliminating operational fragility, unifying fragmented data estates, and enabling AI-driven innovation, Databricks provides the technical foundation for AGL's transformation to Australia's leading integrated energy company in a decarbonising economy.
