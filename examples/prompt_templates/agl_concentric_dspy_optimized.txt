===== CRITICAL TEXT ACCURACY =====
SPELLING MUST BE PERFECT. Double-check ALL text before finalizing:
- "Databricks" (not "Databrick")

===== LAYER STRUCTURE (Inside Out) =====

1. THE CORE (Center Bullseye)
   - Visual: Deep navy circle (#1E212D) with subtle radial gradient to black
   - [USE EXACT Image 4: Databricks Logo] in WHITE - prominent and centered - copy pixel-for-pixel
   - [ALSO INCLUDE Image 5: Delta Lake Logo] - positioned near or within core - copy pixel-for-pixel
   - Text: "Single Source of Truth" (white, bold)
   - Sub-text: "Delta Lake (S3 & ADLS)" (light gray)
   - Add soft outer glow to make it pop

2. THE INTELLIGENCE LAYER (Ring 1)
   - Split into 3 segments with subtle gradients (Light Grey #F5F5F5 to #EBEBEB)
   - Each segment has soft inner shadow for depth

   Segment 1 - GOVERN:
   - [USE EXACT Image 7: UC Logo] - prominent with label - copy pixel-for-pixel (pink squares, yellow triangles, hexagon)
   - Text: "Lineage & Metric Views" (dark gray)

   Segment 2 - INGEST:
   - Text: "Lakeflow Connect"
   - Sub-text: "SQL Server & ZeroBus"

   Segment 3 - PREDICT:
   - Text: "Genie, AIBI & Agent Bricks"

3. THE OPERATIONAL CLOUD LAYER (Ring 2)
   - Split Vertically with CLEAR visual distinction
   - Use gradients and subtle shadows to separate sections

   LEFT SECTION - Customer Markets (AWS):
   - Background: Warm gradient (#FFF8E7 → #FFE5CC)
   - [USE EXACT Image 2: AWS Logo] - large, top of section - copy pixel-for-pixel from uploaded image
   - [USE EXACT Image 6: Kaluza Logo Black - THREE BLACK HEXAGONS]: Label "Kaluza" with "Retail Platform" subtitle
     ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT redraw the hexagons! Copy Image 6 pixel-for-pixel from the uploaded logo file!
     The uploaded image shows three black hexagons - use THAT EXACT IMAGE, do not recreate or interpret!
   - System icons with labels:
     • Salesforce (CRM)
     • Amazon Connect (Contact)
     • Electrify Now (App)
   - Data metric: "4.56M Customer Services" (large, bold, prominent)

   RIGHT SECTION - Integrated Energy (Azure):
   - Background: Cool gradient (#E8F4F8 → #D1E7F0)
   - [USE EXACT Image 3: Azure Logo] - large, top of section - copy pixel-for-pixel from uploaded image
   - Sections with icons:
     • Energy Assets: "Ignition Gateway (Liddell/Tomago Batteries)"
     • Energy Markets: "Risk Systems & Trading"
   - Data metric: "32.9 TWh Generation" (large, bold, prominent)

4. THE STRATEGIC ORBIT (Outer Ring - Floating Value Nodes)
   - 4 circular nodes with polished styling:
     • Gradient fills (white to light cyan)
     • Soft drop shadows
     • Cyan borders (#00B5E2)
     • Icons inside circles

   Positions and content:
   1. Top Left: "NPS Leadership" | Target: +20 | Icon: upward arrow
   2. Top Right: "Green Revenue" | Target: +85% | Icon: leaf/growth
   3. Bottom Right: "Asset Flexibility" | 5.3 GW Capacity | Icon: battery/power
   4. Bottom Left: "Orchestration" | 1.49 GW VPP | Icon: network nodes

   - Connect nodes to inner rings with cyan dashed lines
   - Add subtle glow effect to connection lines

===== FINAL POLISH =====
- Ensure all logos are high-contrast and clearly visible
- Use consistent spacing and alignment throughout
- Add subtle texture/noise to backgrounds for richness (optional)
- Make sure the diagram looks professional enough for C-suite presentation
- Text must be PERFECTLY SPELLED - review everything twice!
- Optimize layout for 16:9 viewing (horizontal emphasis)
