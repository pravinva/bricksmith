Create a professional 12-month migration architecture diagram showing AGL's journey from Synapse to Databricks.

CRITICAL LOGO REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ONLY the logos provided in the logo kit - do not generate or substitute logos
- This is an AZURE environment - NO AWS logos anywhere
- Use Delta Lake logo ONLY - do NOT use Iceberg logo
- For Unity Catalog governance, use the "Unity Catalog Logo" (Image 1 - pink squares, yellow triangles, navy hexagon) - do NOT use any other Unity Catalog icon

LAYOUT: THREE HORIZONTAL TIERS (Top → Middle → Bottom)

=== TOP TIER: CURRENT STATE ===
Header: "TODAY: Synapse-Centric Architecture"
Color: Purple tones

Simple left-to-right data flow:
Source Systems → SAP HANA → Azure Data Factory → Databricks (Bronze Only) → Azure Synapse → Power BI

Labels:
- Databricks box: "Bronze Layer Only"
- Synapse box: "Silver / Gold / Analytics"

=== MIDDLE TIER: 12-MONTH MIGRATION ===
Header: "12-Month Transformation"
Color: Grey tones

Chevron timeline with key details:
- Phase 1-2: Foundation & Governance (Unity Catalog deployment, RBAC setup)
- Phase 3-4: Platform & Data Products (Metadata-driven ingestion framework)
- Phase 5-6: Migration Planning (LakeBridge Assessment, wave sequencing)
- Phase 7-9: Migration Execution (4 Waves: Energy Markets → Customer Markets → Energy Assets → Decommission)
- Phase 10-11: Enablement & AI CoE (1000 users trained, AI Center of Excellence)
- Phase 12: Complete Migration (Synapse decommissioned, AI at Scale)

Key elements to show:
- Migration Control Tower (real-time validation, monitoring)
- Wave progress indicators
- Federation layer for zero-downtime during migration

=== BOTTOM TIER: FUTURE STATE ===
Header: "TARGET: Databricks Data Intelligence Platform"
Color: Orange tones

Simple left-to-right data flow:
Source Systems → Lakeflow Connect → Databricks (Full Lakehouse with Delta Lake) → AI/BI & Apps (inside Databricks)

Labels:
- Show Bronze → Silver → Gold all within Databricks
- Unity Catalog for governance - USE THE UPLOADED UNITY CATALOG LOGO (Image 1: pink squares, yellow triangles, navy hexagon in center) - this is CRITICAL
- AI/BI Dashboards and Apps as the consumption layer (NOT Power BI)
- AI Center of Excellence

Benefits: "43% Cost Savings | 3.5× Performance | AI at Scale"

=== VISUAL STYLE ===
- Clean, minimal design - avoid clutter
- NO random badges or floating labels
- Use the provided logo kit images
